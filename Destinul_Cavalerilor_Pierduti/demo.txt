You are a traveler in a strange land. You seek work, but for now you drinking at a tavern. You go to the bar to order another drink.
On the way you stumble over a soldier's foot. He aproaches you, angry. You're what he's been looking for all night: an excuse to get his knuckles bloody.

YOU
'I am an emissary on a secret mission from the queen. Kill me at your peril.'

This is, of course, a bold-faced lie. But you say it with such conviction that the soldier scrunches up his face, uncertain.

SOLDIER
'What sort of secret mission?'

YOU
'If I told you, it wouldn't very well be a secret, would it?'

The soldier considers this and nods, impressed.

SOLDIER
'It is a rare honor to meet a member of the queen's left hand.'

He claps you on the shoulder.

SOLDIER
'By her grace.'

YOU
'In her, all things are possible.'

The soldier pounds his chest. He marches away into the crowd, hollering for more ale.

introductionOfBarnes morning null GetGoldAction
A strange man aproaches you. He is dressed in a long coat and a wide-brimmed hat. He sits down at your table and introduces himself as Barnes.

BARNES:
I saw you how you handled that soldier. You have a quick wit and a quicker hand. I have a proposition for you. I am a member of the queen's left hand. I have a mission that requires a certain... finesse. Are you interested?

YOU:
What's the pay?

BARNES:
More than you can spend in a lifetime.

YOU:
I'm in. What is the mission?

BARNES:
There is a dragon who built a nest near the queen's castle. We need you to kill it.

YOU:
That's it?

BARNES:
That's it. Here is an advance on your pay. 

(He slides a bag of gold across the table.)

BARNES:
You will get the rest after you kill the dragon.

Barnes stands up and leaves the tavern. You are left with a bag of gold and a mission to kill a dragon.
You retire in the inn for the night. The next day you set out to kill the dragon.
